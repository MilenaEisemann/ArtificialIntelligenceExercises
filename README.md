# ArtificialIntelligenceExercises


This repository holds some implementations of algorithms we learned about in the course aboute Artificial Intelligence.

The first package contains different approaches to solve an Eight Puzzle, namely Breadth-First-Search, Depth-First-Search, iterative deepening and A*-Search.

The other package uses some test data sets and implements the kNearesNeighbour algorithm with crossvalidation.
